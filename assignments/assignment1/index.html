  <h3>Acronym App (P3 - Assignment 1)</h3>

  <hr width=50% align=left>
  <h4>Overview of the Acronym App</h4>

<P> 

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using Android
to develop an Acronym app using the Retrofit library and an Android
Content Provider and SQLite database.  Retrofit is used to obtain
expansions of an acronym from an Acronym web service.  This data is
then stored in a timeout cache that uses an SQLite database-backed
Content Provider for storage.  The user will provide an acronym as a
String (such as "BBC") and a List of AcronymData will be returned to
the AcronymActivity, which will display the expanded acronym data in a
ListView.

</P>

Retrofit is covered in the following videos:

    </UL>
    
Android Content Providers and SQLite will be covered in Live Lecture
videos presented in weeks 1 and 2 of this MOOC.  There are also some
pre-recorded videos on these topics available at

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/juleswhite/mobilecloud-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment1"></a>.
    Pull the appropriate skeleton code into your repository, read it
    carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers, which reside in the
    following Java source files: AcronymOps.java,
    AcronymProvider.java, DeleteCacheReceiver.java, and
    ContentProviderTimeoutCache.java.
    
    </p> 

    <p> Note that there are no automated unit tests for this
    assignment.  Instead, you'll know the program is working when you
    can successfully access, store, and display the acronym expansions
    from the Acronym web service. However, make sure your program
    works for both valid and invalid input.  </p>

<h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
<p>

This assignment is designed to deepen your understanding with the
Retrofit library and Android's Content Providers and SQLite databases.
It's recommended to watch the videos listed above and look at the <A
HREF="https://github.com/juleswhite/mobilecloud-15/tree/master/ex/WeatherServiceProvider">WeatherServiceProvider
example</A> to gain a better understanding of how to structure your
solution.  Start early and please come to Virtual Office Hours if you
have questions or run into problems.  </p>
