  <h3>Assignment 3: Video Upload/Download Project</h3>

  <hr width=50% align=left>
  <h4>Overview of the Video Upload/Download Project</h4>

  <p> 

The purpose of this "mini-project" assignment is to give you
experience using Android and Spring to develop a complete
client/server Video Upload/Download app.  The client-side of this app
runs on an Android device and uses Content Providers to store the
videos and associated meta-data on the device.  It also uses Retrofit
to upload and download videos via an extension of the Web Service
server you implemented in <A
HREF="https://github.com/juleswhite/mobilecloud-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment2">Assignment
2</A>.  You must therefore have a working version of Assignment 2's
Video Service to complete this assignment, as well as a good grasp of
the material covered in the lectures from weeks 1 through 4.  </P>

<P> Since this is a mini-project, there will be no skeletons, though
we will walk through an example of a Video Upload app in the week 4
Live Lectures that provides guidance on key aspects of the assignment.
You therefore have a great degree of flexibility in how you design and
implement this app, as long as it meets the following server- and
client-side requirements:  </P>

<UL> 
<LI><strong>Server-side requirements</strong>

    <UL>
    <LI> <P> The Video Service should enable each video to have a
             "star" rating associated with it, where "5 stars" is the
             highest rating and "1 star" is the lowest rating. </P>

     <LI> <P> The Video Service should enable clients to store the
              star rating of a video anonymously (i.e., no need to
              track/authenticate the identify of a client). </P>

    <LI> <P> The Video Service should must enable a client to obtain
             the average of the star ratings of a video. </P>
    </UL>
</LI>

<LI><strong>Client-side requirements</strong>

    <UL> 

    <LI> <P> The client must handle runtime configuration changes
             robustly, i.e., it should be able to handle screen
             orientation changes while uploading/downloading videos.
             Information on how to handle these types of changes is
             available <A
             HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html">here</a>
             A video outlining several approaches to runtime
             configuration changes appears <A
             HREF="https://class.coursera.org/posacommunication-001/lecture/235">here</a>.
             </P>
    
    <LI> <P> The client should use Retrofit to communicate with the
             Video Service, though none of these communications should
             block the UI thread. </P>

    <LI> <P> The client should allow uploading a video to the Video
             Service by making the appropriate Retrofit calls to the
             Service.  It should either enable <A
             HREF="http://developer.android.com/training/camera/videobasics.html">recording</A>
             a video and/or <A
             HREF="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html#Storage">using
             the Android Gallery</A> app to get a video to upload to
             the Video Service (you must implement one of these
             mechanisms, it optional to implement both). <EM>
             (<strong>Caution:</strong> If you decide to get video
             from the Gallery make sure the minimum SDK of your client
             is API 19, as discussed here <A
             HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20067508/get-real-path-from-uri-android-kitkat-new-storage-access-framework">here</a>)
             </EM> </P>

    <LI> <P> The client should limit the size of an uploaded video to
             50MB or less.  The client should display an error toast
             if the the upload video size is greater than 50MB.  </P>

    <LI> <P> The client should download a video from the Video Service
             by making the appropriate Retrofit calls.  Downloaded
             videos can be stored in either <A
             HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal">internal
             storage</a> or <A
             HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal">external
             storage</a>. <P>

    <LI> <P> The client should play the downloaded video or have an
             option to download it if it is not present in device. You
             can use <A
             HREF="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/VideoView.html">VideoView</A>
             or use an <A
             HREF="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_VIEW">
             ACTION_VIEW</A> implicit Intent to play video using
             another Video app on the Android device.  </P>

     <LI> <P> The client should allow the user to give a star rating
              (i.e., a 1 through 5 star rating) to a video and upload
              that information to the Video Service via a Retrofit
              call. </P>

    <LI> <P> Since the information about the recorded videos or
             Gallery videos are stored in the Android <A
             HREF="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.html">MediaStore</A>
             Content Provider, which you can query to access meta-data
             and media content about videos stored on the device.  You
             should use a <CODE>CursorLoader</CODE>,
             <CODE>AsyncQueryHandler</CODE>, or <CODE>AsyncTask</CODE>
             to access data from the Content Provider
             concurrently. </P>

    <LI> <P> The client should implement its own Content Provider to
             store Video meta-data, such as <U><CODE>id</CODE></U>,
             <U><CODE>title</CODE></U>, <U><CODE> duration</CODE></U>,
             <U><CODE> contentType</CODE></U>,
             <U><CODE>data_url</CODE></U>, and
             <U><CODE>star_rating</CODE></U>.  In addition to these
             fields, you are free to store any other data you like in
             your client's Content Provider.</P>

     <LI> <P> The client should make the appropriate Retrofit calls to
              the Video Service to get the list of available videos
              (along with the average star ratings) and display them
              on the device.  </P>

In addtion to the standard libraries packaged with Android, you can
only use the following libraries in your Video Upload/Download
project:

        <UL> 
            <LI> Retrofit </LI>
            <LI> Gson </LI>
            <LI> Jackson Annotations </LI>
            <LI> Commons IO </LI>
            <LI> Spring </LI>

  <h4>Implementation Hints</h4>
  <p>  <UL> 
           <LI>
             After recroding a video or after getting the Video from Gallery, you will get a Video Uri to that Video
             in the Android MediaStore Content Provider. Query that Uri to get the information you need like
             <STRONG>title, duration, contentType(which is stored as Mime_Type in Android).</STRONG>
             You can use this info and upload it to Server.
           </LI>
          </LI>

           <LI>All the Videos and the Recorded Videos that are public are stored in Android MediaStore Content Provider.
               To get the Video data from Android MediaStore you should query the <strong>MediaStore.Video.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI..</strong>
               All the Columns to query for Video Data are present in <strong>MediaStore.Video.Media.***</strong></LI>
          </LI>

           <LI> You can get some hints from the AutogradingTest of <A
           HREF="https://github.com/juleswhite/mobilecloud-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment2">Assignment
           2</A> on how to upload and download Videos.</LI>

           <LI> You can reuse the VideoSvcApi, Video, and VideoStatus components from Assignment 2.</LI>

           <LI> You can also reuse any code from your previous
           projects, as well as any example code provided for these
           MOOCs.</LI>

        </UL>

<h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
<p>

This assignment is designed to deepen your understanding on how to
create and integrate an Android client containing Content Providers
with an extended version of your Video Service implementation from
Assignment 2.  We encourage you to be as creative as you'd like, as
long as you meet the requirements described above.  If you have
questions please come to Virtual Office Hours and/or post them on the
discussion forums.
